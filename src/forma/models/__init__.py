"""Forma model package.

Only the Forma model itself is re-exported here. The competitor models
(``baselines``, ``chained_gbm``, ``ffnn``, ``chronos_ts``, ``naive``) are
imported directly by their training scripts so that a Forma-only inference
install never pulls in scikit-learn / xgboost / lightgbm.
